## Hugo Mockup Landing Page

This is a mockup of a landing page for a fake product called RadioPlayer. This project was created to practice using Hugo, a website building framework, with Bootstrap. This project was deployed with GitHub Pages and can be viewed at [claraxfee.github.io/hugo-mock-landing-page/](https://claraxfee.github.io/hugo-mock-landing-page/)

In this project, see USER_STORIES.md for User Stories and some practice with product development and design. While building the project, I developed the following skills:

- [ ] HTML and CSS: customized the color palette and visual elements, including logos and fonts, on the landing page
- [ ] Web design principles: re-created a sample landing page and sample "post" and "featured post" pages
- [ ] Product design: created a list of features and selling points for the product RadioPlayer
- [ ] Hugo and Bootstrap frameworks
- [ ] Deploying a website with GitHub Pages
